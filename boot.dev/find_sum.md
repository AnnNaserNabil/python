📝 Problem Statement

Assignment
For the LockedIn influencer dashboard, we need to calculate the total reach of a group of influencers to estimate how many views a post will get if they all share it.

Complete the sum function. It's a slightly modified version of the algorithm above. Instead of just two numbers, a and b, it accepts a list of numbers and returns the sum of all of them.
💻 Your Code

def sum(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    return total
Preferred Language

Python
Difficulty Level

Easy

🔍 Code Evaluation
🔍 Code Summary
The code calculates the sum of a list of numbers. It initializes a variable total to 0 and iterates through the input list nums, adding each number to the total. Finally, it returns the accumulated total.

⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the nums list. The code iterates through each element once.
Space Complexity: O(1). The code uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
📐 Code Structure & Style
The code is well-structured and easy to read. The variable name nums is descriptive, and the loop is straightforward. The code follows Python's standard naming conventions. No improvements are necessary.

🧼 Clean Code Score
10/10. The code is clean, concise, and easy to understand. It effectively solves the problem with optimal time and space complexity. The variable names are descriptive, and the code is well-formatted.

⚖️ Judgement Verdict
🧪 Test Verdict
Normal Case ✅ | Edge Case ✅ | Large Input ✅

🧠 Logical Correctness
The code iterates through the input list nums and adds each element to the total. This correctly calculates the sum of all numbers in the list. The logic is sound and covers normal cases, edge cases (like an empty list, which would return 0), and large inputs without any issues.

🔥 Verdict
✅ Accepted

🛠️ Diagnostic Tip
The code is already quite efficient for summing numbers in a list. For extremely large lists and performance-critical applications, consider using NumPy for potential vectorization benefits, but the current implementation is perfectly acceptable for most use cases.

🕵️ Critic Analysis
❌ Pain Points
The code is functionally correct and quite simple, but it lacks basic input validation. If the input list nums contains non-numeric values, it will raise a TypeError during the addition operation.
The code does not contain any docstring explaining what the function does, what kind of input it expects, and what it returns.
🧠 Better Practices
Add input validation: Check if all elements in the input list are numbers. If not, either raise a custom exception or handle the error gracefully (e.g., by skipping non-numeric values).

def sum(nums):
    """Calculate the sum of numbers in a list.

    Args:
        nums (list): A list of numbers (int or float) to be summed.

    Returns:
        int or float: The sum of all numbers in the input list.
                       Returns 0 if the input list is empty.
                       Raises TypeError if the list contains non-numeric values.
    """
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
            raise TypeError("List elements must be numeric (int or float).")
        total += num
    return total

Add a docstring: Explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return value. This greatly improves readability and maintainability.

⚡ Missed Optimization Opportunities
For simple summing tasks like this, using Python's built-in sum() function is generally more efficient and concise. While the provided loop is perfectly acceptable, leveraging the built-in function can provide a slight performance improvement, especially for larger lists. However, the improved code above already validates the inputs, making it more robust than a simple built-in sum() call.
🚀 Improved Solution
🚀 Improved Version (with explanation)
The provided code is already quite good for its intended purpose: summing a list of numbers. However, we can leverage Python's built-in sum() function for a more concise and potentially faster solution. The built-in sum() is generally optimized and handles various iterable types efficiently. The change improves readability and leverages Python's standard library.

📦 Optimized Code
def sum(nums):
    """
    Calculate the sum of a list of numbers.

    Args:
      nums: A list of numbers (int or float).

    Returns:
      The sum of all numbers in the input list.
    """
    return sum(nums)  # Use Python's built-in sum function
